   5) XY Problem [(English | Read)](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem)
   6) Ask a binary question if possible. (I.e., True/false)
   7) If not, Ask enclosed question if possible. (I.e., question that has expected answer; E.g., Which color? "Red", "Green", "Blue")
   8) If not, ask open questions and supply atomic information in an enumerated form. (E.g., "How to study Machine Learning?" 1. I know math. 2. I know Programming Languages.)
   9) **Examples of good question:**
      1) What is the best approach to tackle problem X in data science? Can anyone suggest a relevant article, book, or online course that could help?
      2) Can someone confirm if my understanding of regularization in machine learning is correct? If not, what are the key points I need to revise?
      3) I am working on a project that involves building a recommendation system for an e-commerce website. Can anyone suggest a specific algorithm or approach that could be suitable for this task?
      4) Here's a code snippet that implements the concept of feature scaling. Can anyone help me identify any issues or improvements that could be made to the code?
        ```python
        def feature_scaling(X):
            mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
            std_dev = np.std(X, axis=0)
            X_scaled = (X - mean) / std_dev
            return X_scaled
        ```
   10)  Note: Atomic information is the simplest form of information possible that can not be further broken down into even simpler data and can never hold more than a single meaning.
1) **Who to ask before you ask?**
   - Only reliable person that is in charge, or has been charge, or reached the end of the road you want to take.
   - Never rely on an answer/course even if it is free before performing rule 1 above.
